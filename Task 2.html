		 Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the
		
		<a href="https://www.google.com/">Partition of the British Indian Empire,</a> 
		
		 which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions

		 after a
		
		<a href="https://www.google.com/">nine-month-long civil war.</a> 
		
		 In the following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by the
		 governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly 
		 alternated between civilian and military, democratic and
		 authoritarian, relatively
		
		<a href="https://www.google.com/">secular</a> 
		
		 and
		
		<a href="https://www.google.com/">Islamist.<sup>[19]</sup></a> 
		
		 Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a
		
		<a href="https://www.google.com/">parliamentary system</a>
		
		 with periodic elections.
